> Is there a small, very talented, focused, dedicated team that's willing to take the risks and make something happen? That's the scarce commodity, not money. The world is awash in money.

How is it possible that tech giants with billions in cash, elite talent, and cutting-edge infrastructure are getting leapfrogged by five-person startups in breakthrough technologies? Why hasn’t Google — the king of search — been unable to deliver a dominant AI search tool, and is instead playing catch-up to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity?

What is stopping CEOs from saying: Here, take five brilliant people, unlimited capital, and go build a competitive product using this new technology?

## The Paradox of Success
Big companies are kings in their domain. They handle incremental change reasonably well — sometimes even brilliantly — but they rarely excel at capitalizing on revolutionary technology. Why?

Their success in their domain leads both to unimaginable profit and their inability to be competitive in new technologies.

When a core product strategy is winning, the entire organization orients around maintaining and growing that success. There’s no incentive to mess with what already works. Discerning leaders might see the storm coming, but they can do little to sway a massive ship that’s optimized to deliver yesterday’s business model.

By the time it's obvious a new technology threatens the core business, the company begins reorienting. But now the task is far harder: rebuild the company's philosophy, retrain thousands of employees, restructure workflows, and steer institutional momentum in a new direction. It’s almost always too little, too late — as we saw with IBM, Nokia, and BlackBerry.

Within large companies, innovation is often a proof-of-concept demo on a slide deck — not a real product. Betting on a new, unproven technology is risky when the cost of failure could jeopardize jobs, reputation, and stability. The size of the workforce becomes a liability, and the core revenue stream is too precious to endanger. Bureaucracy, legal concerns, compliance, and brand protection act like brakes — no matter how much raw talent is in the building.

Innovation in big companies isn't a capability problem. It's a structural and incentive problem. Their greatness in the past becomes the gravity well that pulls every new idea back to the old roadmap.

## Where Startups Win
Startups aren't weighed down by prior success, they're fighting to stay afloat with a completely novel product strategy. Their survival is under threat from day one and this incentive drives them to succeed, quickly. They are not weighed down by the bureaucracy and overhead that is needed in big companies to continue to dominate their domain. Their task is to either make revolutionary progress in a novel, dynamic domain or perish. As a result startups are primed for disruption using breakthrough technologies, long before incumbents wake up.

But let’s not romanticize it. For every Elon Musk who kept Tesla and SpaceX alive with a last-minute funding lifeline in December 2008, thousands of startups perish silently. Disruption is thrilling, but it comes with immense risk. Most revolutions fail.

## Conclusion
Big companies continue to win in the relatively static domain that they mastered. But the dynamic domain of new technologies and the speed with which startups can move, almost always delivers the one-two punch that is needed to dethrone the king.
